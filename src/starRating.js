        {/* The main part of the code is this lines and lets study them throughtly
        1) Array.from will create an array with the length specified and then it accepts a function with two argument one is the initial element which in this case is _ and another is its index i.e "i".
        3) The function will run to its every index i.e finally to maxrating which was passed to if as a props and execute the action specified into the function and here we are just print our component n number of time.
        4) Easy Example
            Create an array with a mapping function
        const arrMapped = Array.from({ length: 5 }, (_, index) => index * 2);
        console.log(arrMapped); // Output: [0, 2, 4, 6, 8] 
        5) Now here is star component and let's study its feature 
        i) Key props is being passed to its function that will just number the times the component will iterate
        ii) onRate props is passing the handleRating function which is passing i+1 argument that will be stored in rating variable in above function but we are not specifing when will onRate works and for now we know is onRate is capable of changing the rating of the stars.
        full is a varible that will check both rating and temprating varibles and give us respective value of them as a boolean. First it checks the variable temprating if it has falsy value or not if it has falsy value then it will set the full as the boolean by checking the rating varible being greater than or equal to the item clicked and do same for temprating if not zero.
        onHoverIn and onHoverOut are two props that will set the varible of state TempRating to the value as the index of the array i.e Star component as the mouse goes by that and again set that index to zero when passed out to it.
